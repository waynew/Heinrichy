Did you ever wanted to have your own assistant, but the only ones available are for Android/iOS/Windows plus you are 
worried about your personal informations? 

Well, now you can have '**Heinrichy**' which will help you to live in the terminal, because what's the point of searching
the web which can take some time when you can simply just ask Heinrichy?

Heinrichy is python based assistant which can help you with;
- maintaining your schedule
- aswer your questions
- calculate medium-level calculation
And many more modules coming soon!

## Current version
The most recent version is _0.23Alpha which brings:

- 'Back up' answer engine, in case wolframalpha won't have any answers for you, Heinrichy will be able to ask [Evi](https://www.evi.com/)
- Bug fix
- Ability to change format of the date

## Installation
After downloading Heinrichy, run `pip install beautifulsoup` to install Beautiful Soup module which is required. After that all that is left for you to do is to fill in the config file where the values say 'default' (you can also change some other
values which is optional) and then just run 'heinrichy_main.py'.

## Basic questions
```
'schedule'
'whats the day today?'
'whats 100*42?'
'who was 40th president of united states of america?'
'when did binladen died?'
```

## To-do
- [ ] *Search for movies on the hard drive and give info about them*
- [ ] *News from chosen websites*
- [ ] *Show weather*
- [ ] *Give movie/book/music description* 
- [ ] *Currency conversion*
- [ ] *Random fact/jokes/quotes*

## Why Heinrichy?
Name 'Heinrichy' is a modification after the name of famous physicist [Heinrich Friedrich Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_F._Weber) which was Albert Einstein's initial doctoral 
advisor. As Heinrichy was helping Albert Einstein, Heinrichy will help you with day-to-day questions and tasks.
It was made especially for GNU/Linux as members of Linux Master Race also need an assistant, however with few
code modifications, the code should work on Microsoft Windows or MacOS. I've decided to create Heinrichy after
I came across an article where the author was trying to live in the terminal and only use the terminal without any GUI for
30 days. This is nearly impossible without any preparation which is why I created Heinrichy, I wanted to do 
everything in one place in the command line without the need for any user interface.

## How can I help?
If you have any ideas on what I could add to Heinrichy, how I could change it or if you found some interesting
script that I could use as module in Heinrichy, just email me; michpcx@protonmail.ch. Also, if you found some
bugs in the code or you have more efficient way of performing a task, just create new issue in 'Issues' tab.
